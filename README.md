#Wall Display
A project designed to build a webpage to act as an instance of a wall calendar to be displayed using a Raspberry Pi connected to a repurporsed laptop screen and a few hardware buttons to switch from page to page.

###Other potential goals
  - find a touch screen instead and incorporate event adding functionality via on screen keyboard
  - Incorporate voice commands somehow... python? Magic?
